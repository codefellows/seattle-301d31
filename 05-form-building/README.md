=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

Today we'll code together in an in-class workshop to wire up a new page in our blog app. This is done in lieu of a pair-programming assignment. You will individually fork/clone the lab code, get it working condition, and submit a pull request by the time of our next class, just as you have been doing with the paired lab assignments.

Note that we probably will not get to 100% functionality in our workshop today *(gotta leave y'all a little bit of work to do, right?)*, and also that there are optional stretch goals.

We'll not work to a schedule, but instead work for an hour or so, take a break, etc., until we finish (or, more accurately, get as close to finished as we're going to get ;-) within our available time.)

## Daily Plan

**Code review**

- Let's retro the first week of 301!

- We'll try to get everyone a chance to talk about some code. We will also examine the order of code execution in more detail than we did yesterday, including a look at the call stack.

```10-15 minute break```

- Start working on the form building workshop, going until we hit a good stopping point.

```10-15 minute break```

- Resume working on the form workshop until we are out of time.

- You will have the weekend to complete and submit the fully working version of the blog form page.

- **NOTE: You do have a separate lab assignment on Monday morning, so do not count on having that time to complete what we did not finish today.**


## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

* Recap the primary concepts discussed throughout the week.

    * "What have you learned so far?"

    * "What has been challenging to learn?"

    * "What has been helpful?"

* Work through a form-based exercise to harvest data from a form using jQuery, eventually building out a JSON string.

* Discuss 3rd party library integration for dynamic code highlighting and Markdown creation.
