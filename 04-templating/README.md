=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

*Templates have advantages over direct DOM manipulation. Leverage those strengths in the blog by adding in a templating library! We use templating to abstract away the tiresome work of DOM rendering, and this practice is applied in many front-end libraries and frameworks.*

## Daily Plan

**Code review: Let's take a deep look at the previous lab assignment**

  ```10 minute break```

**ES6 arrow functions**

**Templating (slides)**

- What is an HTML templating system?
- Why use templating? How is a templating system useful?

  ```10 minute break```

**Templating with [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/)**

- How did we do templating on Days 2 & 3? Used jQuery to pull HTML from the DOM that we then repurposed.
- Now by putting the template in the `<head>` means there's no concern with it displaying and no need to manage that any longer.
- Handlebars lets us get rid of a lot of the "[brittle](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=brittle+code)" jQuery.
- Look at the [tryhandlebarsjs.com](http://tryhandlebarsjs.com/) demos!
- [Code demo](https://github.com/codefellows/301-04-handlebars-demo) for us to hack together!

**Lab prep**

- Let's review the lab README!
- The skinny: you're getting rid of the old jQuery templating and replacing it with Handlebars!
- 'Staches FTW = **{{WIN}}**

## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

* Identify different approaches to reusable HTML templates

* Effectively use templates to present user-entered (or server-provided) data (methods on the Handlebars object).

* Distinguish between the different Handlebars expression types ( **{{}}** vs **{{{}}}** ).

* Modify and style typographic components (**serif, san-serif fonts, font-size, font-family, color, font-weight**, etc)
