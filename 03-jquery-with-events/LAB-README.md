## User Stories and Feature Tasks

*As a user, I want to be able to filter my articles so that I can selectively view articles by author or by category.*

- Complete the new requirements for setting `data-<attributes>` in your `toHtml()` method.
- Complete the methods for handling filter events when selecting an option from a drop down menu via Authors and Categories so that only the selected articles are displayed on the screen.

*As a user, I want to be able to preview each article so that I can easily view the results and select the one I want to read further.*

- Add an event to reveal a complete article if the user would like to see more of it beyond the teaser.

*As a user, I want tab-based navigation so that I can easily visit other sections of my site.*

- Complete the method `articleView.handleMainNav()` for implementing tab-based event navigation on the page.

*As a developer, I want my code to be thoughtfully organized, easy to read, and executing efficiently.*

- Review and understand the new JS file, `articleView.js`
- Add any new script tags to your HTML.
- Refactor concatenation using template literals.
- Render the app upon page load.

### Stretch Goal

*As a user, I want to be able to collapse an expanded article to the teaser view so that I can more easily scan over a series of articles.*

- Build in functionality such that a user can click on "Show Less" to collapse a full article into a teaser.
