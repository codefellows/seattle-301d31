**Lab Prep & miscellany**

- Let's see it in action!
- Study the starter code! Especially **articleView.js**!
- Here's some things you *might could maybe* need... you should look at the docs in the [jQuery Cheat sheet](http://oscarotero.com/jquery/) to see how they work:

	- animate() [with some **scrollTop** action!]
	- .append()
	- .attr()
	- .click()
	- .data()
	- .each()
	- .fadeIn()
	- .find()
	- .hide()
	- .html()
	- .not()
	- .on()
	- .parent()
	- .text()
	- .val()

## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

* Execute event bindings with jQueryâ€™s `$.on()` method

* Comprehend when event delegation is appropriate.

* Be able to configure event bindings using delegation.

* Familiarity with `data-`attributes & concatenation.
