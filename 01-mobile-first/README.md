=======
## Overview

*This class focuses on the fundamentals of mobile first design and development, and includes discussion of CSS modularity (using SMACSS), layout development, media queries for DESKTOP styling, and overall design best practices.*

## Daily Plan


**9:00am**

- Quick meeting with the class to go over the plan for the day

**10:00am to 1:00pm**

- Individual lab assignments, and lunch

**1:00pm: Class Kickoff with Campus Director Brandy Rhodes**

**2:00p: Lecture**

- 301 is different from 201. ***Very*** different. Let's talk about that...how/when you learned to use the internet, then learned to make things for it. There's a pattern we need to keep in mind.

- Overview of course structure/setup
  1. The evolving blog & starter code
  3. Git flow for labs, all pairs all the time!
  4. Live-server (for now!)

- Typical daily pattern
  - Code Review
  - Lecture/slides/demos on new content
  - Review of the starter code and TODO items for lab

- Our many tools...
  - GitHub: lecture repo and lab organization
  - Canvas
  - Slack
  - YouTube
  - CodePen
  - repl.it

- The MOST USEFUL tool: **The Docs**
  - Learning to autonomously read/use documentation is a critical skill for all devs. You'll also be gaining appreciation and skills for writing docs for your own work as well.
  - Expect that TAs, when you come to them for assistance, will often ask, "What did you find in the documentation?"
  - We will be developing a deeper understanding of the technical foundations of the programming languages we are using, plus utilizing multiple 3rd-party libraries, all of which requires effective use of documentation.
  - In other words... [what does the docs say?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofNR_WkoCE) ;-)

- Discussion on Agile workflow, with slides.
  - Agile vs. waterfall
  - Pair programming
  - Standup meetings
  - User stories
  - Sprints

`10-minute break`

- Overview of MVC

	-  [Another diagram](https://www.zkoss.org/_w/images/c/c1/MVC.png)
	-  [Yet another diagram!](https://basicsofwebdevelopment.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/mvc_role_diagram.png)

- Slides (this will be shared as a PDF in Slack)
  1. SMACSS
  2. RWD

- Responsive design code demo: media queries FTW!

`10-minute break`

- Deep code review of the starter code...
- But first... let's see the solution in action!
- OK, now code review.
- Review of today's lab assignment
	- Let's develop some mobile/responsive super-powers!
	- With a pair, make the blog responsive, so it hides the main navigation menu under a "Hamburger" link on small screens, and unfurls to a row of tab-like links on larger screens.

## Learning Objectives

* What is "Mobile First" design?
* What is "Responsive Web Design" vs. "Adaptive Web Design"? - Discuss the difference between the two
* Formula for flexible layouts
  * Percentage-based Media
  * Media Queries: include logical operators, and media types
  * Fluid Layout
* Viewport and initial-scale meta tag
* Demo via **live-server**.
* Comment out viewport tag, show students what happens when the device-width is unset vs set.
* Review embedded media in RWD; challenges, etc.
* Understanding SMACSS and benefits
* Breakdown common SMACSS stylesheets and usage
* Introduction to IcoMoon icon fonts, how to setup, and usage
* Introduction to students about the use of a vendor directory, as some may not be familiar with the  regular use of third-party code.
* Understand the basics of the `:before` and `:after` pseudo elements - these will be used to display icons on the front end.
* The importance of reading, using, and creating documentation.
